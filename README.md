# Email-Spam-Detection
* An advanced email Spam detection system using machine learning for text-based spam filtering. 
* By employing CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, and various machine learning models including logistic regression, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines (SVC), incoming messages are analyzed for their likelihood of being spam.
* The system processes and categorizes these messages to ensure that only non-spam content reaches users' inboxes, providing a robust defense against unwanted communication and email spoofing. 
* You can also detected whether your recent email is spam or not!
